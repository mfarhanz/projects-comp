### Execution-
Here, it is assumed node.js and MongoDB have been pre-installed.
  
Create a folder to hold the contents of *TwitchDataVisualizer* in the repository, and then extract the given files to the folder. A useful site for this purpose is https://download-directory.github.io/ , allowing you to download any section of a github repository.
  
To run the code, make sure MongoDB is running, by going to its bin directory through the command prompt/terminal and running:   ```mongo```
  
In newer versions this may not work; use this instead:   ```mongod```
  
Usually, the path is, C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin

Once mongo is running in the background, open a terminal in the codeâ€™s root folder/directory, for running the server-side code, and install the dependencies/modules specified in the package.json file on the terminal before running the script.   
Install dependencies -   ``` npm install  ```  
Run the script via -   ``` node app.js  ```  

Once the script is running, the application can be viewed via entering in the web browser:   ```localhost:3000```
